# Simple Sorting
Simple Sorting is a Minecraft mod - made with [Fabric](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric) - which aims to add one function to Minecraft: inventory sorting.

Currently there is no functionality, as this mod has just started development. I will update this README.md, when the mod is usable.
