# Simple Sorting
Simple Sorting is a Minecraft mod - made with [Fabric](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric) - which aims to add one function to Minecraft: inventory sorting.


## Installation

This mod requires Fabric Loader and Fabric API. You can get them here: https://fabricmc.net/ if you haven't already.

- Go to the [latest release](https://github.com/Noitcereon/simple-sorting/releases/tag/0.1.0-MC1.19).
- Download the fabric-simple-sorting-mod-0.1.0.jar 
- Put it into your mods folder 
    - The mods folder should be located in your .minecraft folder (search for %appdata% and go into the .minecraft folder from there)
    - If the mods folder doesn't exist create it. It MUST be named mods exactly.

Depending on your windows size and your GUI scale setting, the location of the button may differ.

It will always appear on the right side of the screen and near the top. (70% away from the left, 10% away from the top)
