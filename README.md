Simple Sorting is a Minecraft mod - made with [Fabric](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric) - which aims to add one function to Minecraft: inventory sorting.


## Installation

There are two ways to install Simple Sorting: manual or semi-automatic with CurseForge.

### CurseForge
If you don't want to manually install it, you can use CurseForge: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/noits-simple-sorting

### Manual
This mod requires Fabric Loader and Fabric API. You can get them here: https://fabricmc.net/ if you haven't already.

- Go to the [latest release](https://github.com/Noitcereon/simple-sorting/releases).
- Download the `noits-simple-sorting-<VERSION>.jar` (or `fabric-simple-sorting-mod-<VERSION>.jar` for version 0.3.0 and earlier.)
- Put it into your mods folder 
    - The mods folder should be located in your .minecraft folder (search for %appdata% and go into the .minecraft folder from there)
    - If the mods folder doesn't exist create it. It MUST be named mods exactly.

- The mods folder should contain, at least, 2 files like this:

- Run the game with your installed Fabric version.

## Usage

Once you've installed it, you should see a Sort button appear in chests and barrels like so:

Depending on your windows size and your GUI scale setting, the location of the button may differ.

It will always appear on the right side of the screen and near the top. (70% away from the left, 10% away from the top)
